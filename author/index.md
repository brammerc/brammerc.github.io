## Short Bio

Hi, I'm Chris. 

Scholar. Gardener. Outdoor adventurer. Aspiring rock climber.  

Born and raised in Nebraska, partial to southern Indiana, enchanted by North Carolina, and seeking my next stop in this great big beautiful world! Alumnus of Truman State University and Indiana University.

Intrigued by human performance, other cultures, classical music, multimedia art, armchair philosophy, great food, and even better conversations.

Seeking to be inspired, to envision the unlikely, to work hard for things that are worth it, and to be surrounded by those who bring out the best in me.

## Specific Work Interests

- I really like to learn, teach, and use new analytical tools and methods, especially those related to [exploratory data analysis](/blog/categories/#exploratory%20data%20analysis).
- I'm interested in improving graphical displays as a means to better understand data through imagery.
- I enjoy solving problems regarding data acquisition, management, analysis, and interpretation in the field of human performance.
- I am fascinated with exploring the vast sea of data related to exercise physiology and biomechanics that [today's technologies](/blog/#products) are producing.  
- I enjoy facilitating students' understanding of statistical science so that they can analyze and interpret data independently.
- I like computer programming, mostly in R and Python, as a means to accomplish many of my other interests listed above. 
- I also like to query large databases using MySQL, especially when I get to use terrific hardware such as <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/bcqt" target="_blank">Big Red II.</a>

## Counsilman Center for the Science of Swimming
Based on the teaching and coaching philosophy of the legendary <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~radiotv/wtiu/doc/docbio.html" target="_blank">Dr. James Counsilman</a>, the Counsilman Center conducts research on all aspects of swim performance as a means to inform the swimming community. Directed by <a href="https://info.publichealth.indiana.edu/faculty/current/stager-joel.shtml" target="_blank">Dr. Joel Stager</a>, the Counsilman Center has provided a number of graduate students, myself included, with the technical knowledge and experience to continue Doc's legacy well into the future.

For an in-depth view of current and past projects, as well as the graduate students and faculty that conduct them:
