Hi, I'm Chris. I developed this website as a resource for my future self and for those out there in the world wide web. My posts tend to pertain to gathering, processing, managing, visualizing, modeling, and analyzing data that I am interested in&mdash;typically concerning the health, physical fitness, and sport domains. The site also serves as a great place to expunge, organize, and display work from ongoing data science projects.

Born and raised in Nebraska, partial to southern Indiana, enchanted by North Carolina, and currently exploring the coast redwoods of northern California. Alumnus of Truman State University and Indiana University.

Intrigued by human performance, other cultures, classical music, multimedia art, armchair philosophy, great food, and even better conversations.

Seeking to be inspired, to inspire others, and to live on the edge between the past and the future, where life is happening!

## Mission
This website aims to educate and inform the audience on the development and implementation of data science processes.

## Specific Objectives
- To demonstrate analytical tools and methods, especially those related to data acquisition, management, exploration, analysis, and interpretation.  
- To provide examples of solutions to problems in the human performance domain.
- To teach the process of data science so that readers are empowered to conduct their own projects independently.
- To explore the vast sea of data related to exercise physiology, motor control, and biomechanics that the latest wearable gadgets are producing.

## Rationale

Some organizations utilize the cost-effective and timely methods of data science to facilitate the decision-making process. Rather than base important decisions solely on wisdom and expertise, the quality of which is often compromised by gut instinct and distorted memories, these organizations enjoy an advantage over their competitors by using the vast historical record of performance to predict the future. Despite the massive amount of data available, the use of advanced satistical and quantitative analyses to drive decisions and actions has been slow to catch on. The reasons for this are multi-faceted, but can be partially explained by a shortage of individuals that not only understand the type and value of information that exists within the data, but also have the skill to extract that value from the data. The challenge, then, and that which constitutes the main purpose of this website, is to meet the growing demand for practitioners with the kind of critical thinking and practical skills that are conducive to an organization's use of data science to facilitate better outcomes.
