# Mission

#### This blog aims to educate and inform stakeholders within the health, physical fitness, and sport domains about how to gather, process, manage, visualize, analyze, and interpret human performance data.

<hr/>
## Specific Objectives
- To teach the process of data science so that readers are empowered to conduct their own projects independently.
- To demonstrate analytical tools and methods, especially those related to [exploratory data analysis](/blog/categories/#exploratory%20data%20analysis).
- To provide examples of solutions to problems regarding data acquisition, management, analysis, and interpretation in the field of human performance.
- To explore the vast sea of data related to exercise physiology, motor control, and biomechanics that [today's technologies](/blog/#products) are producing.

## Rationale
Characterized by exponential growth in data being generated, stored, and shared on a daily basis, the dawning of the information-technology revolution and globalization has led modern health, physical fitness, and sports organizations to consider advanced data analysis techniques to facilitate the decision-making process with the hope of improving their desired outcomes. Rather than base these decisions solely on the wisdom of experts, which is often fraught with gut instinct that leads to unfavorable outcomes, practitioners are now integrating objective evidence derived from data science experiments to make better decisions. The challenge, then, and that which consititutes the purpose of this website, is to train enough data scientists to meet the demand for processing, analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting the ever-growing stock of naturally occurring data.
