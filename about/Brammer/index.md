Hi, I'm Chris. At the moment, I am the only contributor to this blog. <a href="/contact/">Let's start a list!</a>

Teacher. Scholar. Gardener. Outdoor adventurer.

Born and raised in Nebraska, partial to southern Indiana, enchanted by North Carolina, and seeking my next stop in this great big beautiful world!  Alumnus of Truman State University and Indiana University.

Intrigued by human performance, other cultures, classical music, multimedia art, armchair philosophy, great food, and even better conversations.

Seeking to be inspired, to inspire others, and to live on the edge between the past and the future, where life is happening.
