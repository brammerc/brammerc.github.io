The dawning of the information-technology revolution and globalization, which can be characterized by exponential growth in data being generated, stored, and shared on a daily basis, has led modern sport organizations to consider <!--more--> ![Read more]({{ site.url }}/public/images/pool_current.png){:class="post-image"}  advanced data analysis techniques to find the detail that catalyzes even the slightest improvement in one of their many functions, both on and off the field. No longer is the experiential wisdom of sports experts (e.g., coaches, managers, scouts) sufficient to effectively inform the decisions that are made to facilitate improvements in organizational outcomes. Rather than base these decisions solely on expert knowledge, which is often fraught with gut reaction that leads to unfavorable outcomes, sports stakeholders can now easily integrate objective evidence derived from experimental analysis to make better decisions. These experiments do not take place in a well-controlled laboratory, however, but are instead the competitions themselves. Advanced analysis of competition data is an improvement upon traditional scientific processes that are a challenge for most organizations because of resource constraints (e.g., time and money), and because laboratory experiments often have limited real-world applicability. Thus, for sports organizations and teams seeking a competitive edge, a relatively quick and inexpensive solution is to complement domain expertise with evidence-based information derived from advanced analysis of the ever-growing stock of naturally occurring data.

The most widely known example of an organization that supplemented intuition and experience with advanced analytics to facilitate the process of making important decisions is best described in Michael Lewis' book and the ensuing film titled, _Moneyball_, in which the Oakland Athletics (A's) used cutting-edge analyses of past performance data to identify the best players that were undervalued by the market. One of the metrics that the A's used to better evaluate players was 'on-base percentage,' which was a variable the team's analysts found to be a better predictor of the extent to which a player helped his team score more runs, as opposed to the more popular measures of batting performanceâ€”'batting average' and 'runs batted in.' By challenging traditional expert opinion regarding batting performance, Oakland identified and drafted a number of overlooked players that would help lead them to a record 20-game winning streak and a division title in 2002, despite having the third lowest team payroll in Major League Baseball (MLB). Though the Oakland A's was not the first team to utilize deep analyses of existing performance data to gain a competitive edge, their story popularized the idea that valuable information can be gleaned from past performances.

Despite an abundance of available data and an increased utilization of data-driven decision-making in the sports domain, a number of sports organizations all too rarely leverage existing data into the sort of knowledge that informs important decisions and benefits organizational outcomes. Some organizations have gathered a plethora of data, but are often overwhelmed by its volume and variety, are unsure of how best to utilize this information resource, and/or cannot afford to invest in a more advanced analytical infrastructure. Other organizations are either oblivious to the potential value of data as information, or are resistant to its use. Regardless, many sports organizations have yet to fully develop the capability to aggregate, analyze, and use data to make informed and actionable decisions that ultimately lead to improved outcomes.

However, recent advances in hardware and software technologies that serve to collect, manage, process, analyze, and visualize data are making it easier for sports organizations to extract valuable information from the data. No longer are investments in advanced data infrastructures and analytical initiatives limited to major sports organizations with the resources to do so. In fact, the combination of a lot of data being freely available online and the continual development of open source programming and statistical software, many sports fans and hobbiests are practicing data analysis from their home offices.  

Additional data collected on the coaching practices, when combined with the performance data, can provide a wealth of information that can be utilized in the development of future coaching training programs. Three important problems in which the data can be use to help solve: talent identification, bias discovery and/or confirmation, dropout, coaching efficacy. 

Within this database lays a vast potential to inform all of the sport of swimming's stakeholders


We are currently living in a world where a vast sea of data is being captured on nearly all athletes, and with such detail, that our ability to extract and interpret valuable information from this data is often overwhelmed. 

This is especially true in the sport of competitive swimming. With more data being captured and recorded at a greater velocity and from a larger variety of sources, the need for data management, exploration, analysis, and interpretation is clear; otherwise, what's the point of collecting the data in the first place! The role of data scientist aims to fill this need, offering organizations a way to integrate [computer science skills, statistical knowledge, and domain expertise](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) to take full advantage of the available data by discovering valuable insights that would otherwise be left uncovered.

USA Swimming (USAS), the organization that governs competitive swimming in the United States, currently has the richest database of any other country, thanks to an information systems initiative implemented in 2003. The volume and variety of the data gives USAS the potential to access valuable information on how and why swimmers and teams are different from one another.
