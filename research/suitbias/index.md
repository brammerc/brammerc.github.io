# Predictive modeling to assess the impact of 'floatation' suits

#### This research presents objective evidence that the 2008 Olympic and 2009 World Championship swimming competitions were biased due to the neoprene-panelled swimsuits popular at that time

The longitudinal progression of athletic records has been described by best fit curves which can be used to extrapolate future athletic performances. Any subsequent significant deviations from these curves would suggest compelling evidence of cataclysmic changes introduced into the sport. Given anecdotal reports of the performance enhancing effect of the neoprene-laden full-body swimsuits released to the competitive swimming market in 2008, we evaluated past elite swim performances to determine if the new suits biased the 2008 Olympic competition. 

Model predictions for each event at the 2008 Olympic swimming competition were compared to actual performances. The results of the 2008 swimming competition were, in general, exceptionally fast and do not fit the expectations of our mathematical modelling and based upon prior performances. With the exception of the 1996 Games (which resulted in performances that were significantly slower than expected), there is little to no evidence to suggest any pervasive performance enhancing bias existed before 2008 for men or women. Until now, our predictive modelling was largely successful in describing swim performance at the elite level. We conclude that this bias had a dominant role in enhancing performance in a manner that was inconsistent with the natural progression of swim performance observed over the last half century.

Personal communication with coaches and athletes at this level has not provided any evidence of innovation other than perhaps the introduction of new technology suits into the sport. Due to the nature of commerce and claims of "proprietary" knowledge, very little specific data exist identifying the magnitude (if any) of the effect of the newest generation suits on swim performance. While the current study does not directly measure the effect of the new technology swim suits, the athletes and their performances suggest that these suits (which did not exist prior to 2008) have introduced unnatural rates of improvement into the sport.
